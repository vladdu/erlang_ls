An Erlang server using Microsoft's Language Server Protocol 3.0.

## Rationale

## Principles

## History of the project

I am an Erlang developer and an affectionate Emacs user. For most of
my professional career I have been using Emacs's
[erlang-mode](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/tools/erlang_mode_chapter.html)
and, once available, the [EDTS](https://github.com/tjarvstrand/edts)
suite, whose author is a former colleague. These two tools, combined
with a few extra customizations and additions, provided me with a
decent development environment for Erlang. I felt quick and productive
when writing and navigating Erlang code and I never really missed a
more powerful IDE.

I occasionally experienced a few bugs with these tools and identified
a few potential improvements, but nothing major that would trigger the
quest for a better alternative. At some point I started consulting for
a company which used _comma-first_ indentation and Emacs' automatic
indentation started to break here and there. I started switching
heavily between projects using different versions of the Erlang
Runtime system and EDTS, even if in theory supported multiple OTP
runtimes, occasionally started to crash and spam my _EDTS_ buffer with
error messages related to
[xref](http://erlang.org/doc/apps/tools/xref_chapter.html), the Erlang
cross-reference tool. Reverting Emacs buffers, killing and restarting
the EDTS process, became normal part of my developer workflow. After a
recent upgrade, EDTS started to perform poorly. It would get
occasionally stuck and I had to press `C-g` a few times to recover
control of my Emacs. When working on huge projects (in terms of lines
of code), EDTS was freezing my entire Emacs every time I was
navigating into a newly-opened module.

It was 2018 when I contacted EDTS' author to ask if I was the only one
experiencing these issues. Some of these problems were apparently
known, but not easily reproducible. Also,
[Thomas](http://github.com/tjarvstrand) (EDTS's author) was not using
Erlang anymore, so he had very little incentive in improving or even
maintaining EDTS. I shivered for a second, since I was relying so much
on EDTS. It was at that point that Thomas asked me if I was interested
in contributing to EDTS or even becoming a maintener for it.

I started diving into the EDTS code-base and learnt about its
architecture. It was surprisingly interesting. At start-up, EDTS would
spin up a distributed Erlang node (named _edts_) and then a separate
Erlang node for each _project_. The two Erlang nodes would communicate
between each other using the standard Erlang Distribution
Protocol. The _edts_ node exposed an HTTP API that the Emacs client
interacted with. This setup allowed (with some limitations) different
versions of the Erlang runtime for different projects. The approach
had a lot of potential. One could implement a lot of interesting
features in an easy way by using the standard Erlang libraries. In
principle, if one could make the HTTP API generic enough and not
Emacs-specific, other editors could have leveraged these libraries. This
would have been particularly beneficial in a small community like the
Erlang one. Just think about it: a bug fix to the way return values
for a `spec` are indented would automatically be available to users of all
major text editors and IDEs. Unfortunately, the client part in EDTS
was still quite heavy and a lot of functionalities
(e.g. auto-completion) were too coupled with Emacs and implemented
directly in Emacs Lisp. My interest, though, was growing.

A couple of weeks later I attended the [Code
Beam](https://codesync.global/conferences/code-beam-sto-2018/)
conference in Stockholm. I was sharing my ideas with a few attendees
when [Csaba](https://github.com/hcs42) (co-author of
[vim-erlang](https://github.com/orgs/vim-erlang)) told me that
[Vlad](https://github.com/vladdu) (co-author of the
[erlide](https://github.com/erlide) Eclipse plugin) was working on a
similar project. It was time for me to attend [Vlad's
talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IXgecLsA9g).

At Vlad's talk I learnt that the idea of having a well defined API
between text editors (or IDEs) on one side and _language-specific_
servers on the other one [was not so new](https://langserver.org/). It
was not surprising to see that the driver for such an approach was
_Microsoft_, which obviously faced the problem of supporting multiple
programming languages (e.g.. _C_, _C++_, _C#_, _F#_, _TypeScript_) in
a common IDE (i.e. _Visual Studio_). What was surprising (at least for
me) was that Microsoft actually defined and open-sourced a
fully-bledged [Language Server
Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification)
(aka _LSP_) to solve the problem, and that all major text editors and
IDEs (including Emacs \o/) [already implemented a
client](https://langserver.org/#implementations-client) for it.

I started looking for implementations of Language Servers for Erlang
and found a few ones (including one for Elixir), all at different
development stages and using different approaches (see the _other LSP
implementations_ section for details).

It was time to roll my own.

## Other LSP Implementations

_erlang_ls_ is not by any means the _first_, the _only_ or the _best_
Erlang implementation of the [Language Server
Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification)
(aka _LSP_). This section aims at covering the other existing
implementations, explaining differences and similarities with
_erlang_ls_. Since things around _erlang_ls_ will inevitably evolve,
this section will tend to become outdated very quickly. Therefore,
feel free to contribute by pull-requesting a change whenever deemed
necessary. Also consider that _erlang_ls_ is an extremely young
project and that some of the functionalities discussed here are not
fully implemented, yet. The intent of this section is not to criticize
other implementations, but to explain why a new implementation was
created. As always in software design, there are no _best_ solutions,
but choices and trade-offs.

### sourcer

To use the author's own words,
[sourcer](https://github.com/erlang/sourcer) is the _reincarnation_ of
a 7 years old, battle-tested, Erlang plugin for Eclipse, named
[ErlIDE](https://erlide.org/), to use Microsoft's _Language Server
Protocol_.

The project is split into two separate Erlang applications:
`lsp_server` and `sourcer`. `lsp_server` is the actual implementation
of the _Language Server Protocol_ (aka _LSP_) and it supports both TCP
and STDIO transports. The application consists of a single
_one_for_one_ supervisor with three child processes. One of the three
children, named _jsonrpc_, is a TCP server responsible for
encoding/decoding LSP messages and for dispatching these messages
from/to the other two children: `lsp_server` and `lsp_client`,
respectively the LSP server itself and a middleman towards the actual
LSP client (i.e. the text editor). The `sourcer` application contains
the port of the _erlide_ libraries to the new format. Here the origin
of the project is clearly visible in the structure of the code-base,
in the references to _erlide_ and the presence of a `src2` folder,
containing all the _erlide_ code not yet ported to the new project. In
reality, the project contains a third Erlang application, named
`erlang_ls` (yes, what a fortunate name collision), but that is just a
wrapper to create an Erlang
[escript](http://erlang.org/doc/man/escript.html) to bootstrap the
whole server, so we can safely ignore it here.

In _sourcer_, a separate worker process is spawn to handle each
individual LSP method (e.g. `textDocument/completion` or
`textDocument/hover`). _sourcer_ uses a mix of OTP patterns and basic,
low-level, Erlang spawning and message passing, which this project
tries to avoid, preferring to adopt OTP guidelines and patterns across
the entire code-base.

_sourcer_ defines the concept of a _cancellable worker_. Essentially,
since every LSP method is executed within a separate process, this
process can be killed at any time. Each worker processes can send
_partial results_ to a central server, which can return these partial
results to the client upon cancellation. This is not the case for the
_erlang_ls_ project, where processes can be killed, but no _partial_
results are sent back to the client. The rationale behind this choice
is that partial result could often be misleading to the end
user. Please notice that _request cancellation_ and _partial results_
are optional features according to the LSP protocol, so both
approaches are valid. Also, partial results are only 
meaningful for some queries, that return lists of things and where it 
is acceptable to not get all results (for example, when renaming 
something, we want all results or none). 

_sourcer_ supports currently only full-text synchronization, meaning 
that upon each change the entire content of the modified buffer is sent 
to the server. All contents for all buffers are stored into the state of a
single process. On the contrary, _erlang_ls_ has a dedicated
supervisor for text synchronization purposes, where each opened buffer
is modelled as a separate Erlang process with its own state, favouring
decoupling.

An interesting idea in _sourcer_ is the presence of a _database_ which
is populated by the worker processes and queried by the LSP server. The
database acts as a memoization tool and avoids re-calculating already
calculated information. It also allows several language servers to interact, 
for example if a project contains Erlang, Elixir and LFE code, and servers 
for all languages are installed and use the database, the clients will
get support for everything, regardless of where it is implemented. 
Furthermore, it is possible to prebuild and distribute a database for 
one's project (or the OTP libraries), so that support is available even if
the source code is not (and there should be a performance improvement too).

_sourcer_ implements a custom scanner and parser, which try to handle
situations where, for example, an un-closed string would provoke the
rest of an Erlang module to be un-parsable. It does so by artificially
adding quotes and other potentially missing tokens. The parser is also 
ignoring the structure of the code, only being interested in finding the 
elements it needs to cross-reference. Having a
temporarily un-parsable module is not considered an actual problem by
the _erlang_ls_ project, which prefers simplicity in this scenario
and uses the default Erlang scanner and parser.

Another reason for having a custom scanner/parser is that we can handle
macros as regular language elements. 

_sourcer_ implements currently some very basic _project_ support, mainly
focusing on [rebar3](https://www.rebar3.org/) conventions. It can then 
support projects with exotic structures, requiring that this structure
is described in a format it can read. _erlang_ls_
tries to be agnostic of the building tool whilst providing _workspace_
functionalities. 

_sourcer_ provides auto-formatting of Erlang modules using custom
tools (i.e. the `sourcer_indent` module, which is matching the indenter
for the emacs-mode). _erlang_ls_ prefers standard
Erlang tools, such as the `erl_tidy` module. 

In the same way,
_sourcer_ prefers to run its own custom cross-reference analysis of
Erlang modules (which handles references to macros, records, record fields 
and types and can also scan comments and for references),
whilst _erlang_ls_ prefers the standard _xref_ tool.
